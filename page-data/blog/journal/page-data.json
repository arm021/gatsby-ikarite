We try to best convey the delicate scents of the flowers that surround us, to offer a unique sensory experience with exceptional textures. Their union with Shea Butter allows us to obtain unique products ... a chic French style. We've already told you about it, Paris is our inspiration ... It's time now to tell you about the city of Grasse, our source of creativity. Grasse, city of the Côte d'Azur, located in the hills of Cannes, is the capital of Perfume since the seventeenth century. The know-how of our perfumers is complete. It begins with the cultivation of the perfume plant. This requires special knowledge: you must master the soil of the region and know its climate. But one must also have botanical skills with the practice of specific techniques of plant grafting. The flowers, whether fresh or dry, have all their specificities. Knowledge of natural raw materials and their transformations is also essential. This is an important stage for the development of the future perfume, since it is at this moment that we extract the fragrant essences. Many prerequisites on the materials and tools used are to be mastered. And finally the most important step because it is a true olfactory architecture, the art of composing a perfume. At Institut Karité Paris, all our perfume formulas are composed in honor of France, and more particularly of Paris. They transport you to a unique universe. As for example Lily of the valley , this very French flower that we offer on the first of May, Labor Day. Its history goes back to Charles IX, who, charmed by his perfume, wished to offer it to all the ladies of his court, the day before his coronation to be lucky. Good luck then taken over by Christian Dior, who made sew a strand in the hems of clothing during parades. This flower has always accompanied the most prestigious weddings such as those of Grace Kelly, Audrey Hepburn, Lady Diana, or more recently Kate Middleton. Or the Rose, flower of love par excellence, celebrating Paris, the most romantic city in the world. It is our range of hand creams that has the largest range of floral scents.","publishedAt":"2019-06-19T15:09:00Z","fields":{"shopifyThemePath":"/blog/journal/article/an-olfactory-journey-to-the-french-riviera"}},{"shopifyId":"Z2lkOi8vc2hvcGlmeS9BcnRpY2xlLzMyMTE4MzA4OTI2","title":"DIY #1 : Shea Butter Gentle Scrub","excerpt":"Our Shea Butters can be used alone for deep action or they can be incorporated into your favorite homemade cosmetics recipes.","content":"Shea Butter moisturizing and regenerating properties make it the best fit for a gentle scrub !
